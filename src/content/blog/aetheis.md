Hi ppl, I made aetheis

It is a little fun and some things don't work but if they don't, please open an issue on my github

[Aetheis Github](https://github.com/PandaTwoxx/Aetheis)

Here is the install link

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PandaTwoxx/Aetheis/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```

If you are on a managed device like a school laptop or don't have sudo, run this

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PandaTwoxx/Aetheis/refs/heads/main/install.sh)" -- --local
```

K bai
